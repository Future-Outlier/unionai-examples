# OpenAI Batch Agent

The Batch API agent allows you to submit requests for asynchronous batch processing on OpenAI.
You can provide either a JSONL file or a JSON iterator, and the agent handles the upload to OpenAI,
creation of the batch, and downloading of the output and error files.

## Installation

To use the OpenAI Batch agent, run the following command:

```
$ pip install flytekitplugins-openai
```
