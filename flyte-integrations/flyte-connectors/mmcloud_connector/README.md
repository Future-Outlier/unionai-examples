# Memory Machine Cloud agent

[MemVerge](https://memverge.com/) [Memory Machine Cloud](https://www.mmcloud.io/) (MMCloud)—available on AWS, GCP, and AliCloud—empowers users to continuously optimize cloud resources during runtime, safely execute stateful tasks on spot instances, and monitor resource usage in real time. These capabilities make it an excellent fit for long-running batch workloads. Flyte can be integrated with MMCloud, allowing you to execute Flyte tasks using MMCloud.
